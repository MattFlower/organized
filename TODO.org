* [COMPLETED] Convert to CoffeeScript
* [COMPLETED] Figure out why I have to toggle to get keybindings to work

    activate your package by default.

  * [COMPLETED] Hitting enter at the beginning of a line shouldn't delete the content of the line
  * [COMPLETED] Highlighting multiple lines and indenting should indent all of the lines
  * [TODO] Number indents need a new type of numbering on indent (7. becomes 7a. or something)
  * [TODO] If you have unindented and that unindent level has a different star type, adopt that star type
  * [COMPLETED] Underlines
    * [COMPLETED] Add grammar for underlined portion
    * [COMPLETED] Add styles for underlines
  * [COMPLETED] bold
    * [COMPLETED] Add grammar for bold
    * [COMPLETED] Add style for bold
  * [COMPLETED] If you newline after a level 1 and there are already indented bullets underneath, the new line
    should be at that new level of depth
* Visibility cycling
  * [TODO] Add folding to menus to raise visibility
  * [TODO] Start supporting folding for '**' style stars (space-indented ones already work)
* Improve return key Support
  * [COMPLETED] If you press ctrl-return you should have a star at the same level on
    a new line.
  * [COMPLETED] If you press return you should get a new line without a star
  * [COMPLETED] Make this behavior configurable so users can turn it off if they
    don't like it.
  * [COMPLETED] If you hit enter on a level created with multiple stars, the new line should also be multi-star
  * [TODO] Figure out why I can't bind shift-enter correctly.
    * This might be due to peculiarity in chromium css specificity.
* [TODO] Add setting to autowrap at gutter

  * Perhaps look at the first 1000 lines of a file -- see if we have more
    tab intentations or whitespace indentations.
  * Whichever line has the highest number wins
  * Ignore lines that have both
  * If sample size is too low, use more lines.
* [TODO] Auto-tab to correct level on paste

  * [TODO] Configuration to show what directories we'll scan for TODO items

  * Figure out how to model the storage of TODO items
    * We should probably model parent-child relationship (parent outline node is a todo and it has children
      that also have todo items).
      * This would allow us to show todo items in search results with the children rolled up by default.  If we unrolled
        then all the items below would show up as well.

* Schedules
  * [COMPLETED] Support "SCHEDULED" tags inside of organized files
  * [TODO] Add key command to add a schedule date
  * [TODO] Create agenda view to show what's coming up

    has a star.
