* [DONE] Release 0.6.0
  SCHEDULED: <2017-03-17 Fri>
* [TODO] Get to 1.0
  SCHEDULED: <2018-06-01 Fri>
* Outlining
  * [TODO] Support lettered indents
  * [TODO] Support roman numeral indenting
  * [TODO] Number indents need a new type of numbering on indent (7. becomes a. or 7.1 or something)
  * [TODO] If you have unindented and that unindent level has a different star type, adopt that star type
* Movement - keystrokes to move around
  * [TODO] Next/Prev bullet at same level
  * [TODO] Up to next highest level
  * [TODO] Move current bullet up / down
* Visibility cycling
  * [TODO] Add folding to menus to raise visibility
  * [TODO] Start supporting folding for '**' style stars (space-indented ones already work)
* Improve return key Support
  * [TODO] Figure out why I can't bind shift-enter correctly.
    * This might be due to peculiarity in chromium css specificity.
* [TODO] Add setting to autowrap at gutter
* [TODO] Different coloring depending on the number of stars in a star block
* [TODO] Properly support soft-tabs settings
* [TODO] Support Atom's auto tab type setting
  * Perhaps look at the first 1000 lines of a file -- see if we have more
    tab intentations or whitespace indentations.
  * Whichever line has the highest number wins
  * Ignore lines that have both
  * If sample size is too low, use more lines.
* [TODO] Auto-tab to correct level on paste

    * [TODO] Option to show tags for todos
    * [TODO] Truncate long todo names
  * [TODO] Setting to auto-hide completed todo items
  * Figure out how to model the storage of TODO items
    * We should probably model parent-child relationship (parent outline node is a todo and it has children
      that also have todo items).
      * This would allow us to show todo items in search results with the children rolled up by default.  If we unrolled
        then all the items below would show up as well.
* Tables
  * [TODO] Syntax highlighting
    * [TODO] Header row is highlighted

  * [TODO] Call atom / nodejs functions in a node
  * [TODO] Call shell scripts from a node
  * [TODO] How do we differentiate "rows" in a column from wrapping text.  Maybe we don't?
  * [TODO] Handle enter key inside of a table column
* Schedules
  * Deadlines
    * [TODO] Syntax highlighting for deadlines
  * [TODO] Create agenda view to show what's coming up
    * Maybe this should be accordian style with both todos and agenda on a
      single page
  * [TODO] Support creating or changing a meeting in your calendar according to
    changes in an organized file
* Quick capture
  * [TODO] Add quick-capture keystroke and dialog box

    * [TODO] C#
  * [TODO] Add support to include libraries and/or classpaths
  * [TODO] Weird error for Java -- talks about not being able to find class instead of code error
  * [TODO] Need process control to be able to stop a process
* Search / Exploration
  * [TODO] Add command to search for a note
    * Maybe https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index

  * [TODO] Saved filters for todo lists
  * [TODO] Saved filters for search / exploration
  * [TODO] Recent searches
    * Need to learn a bit more about serialization here - how much can I reasonably
      store via serialization?  It seems like this will cause a problem at some point
      depending on how much control there is.
* Export
  * [TODO] Figure out how to make a new pane for export, similar to markdown preview
  * [TODO] Export as HTML
  * [TODO] Export as PDF
* Safety
  * [TODO] Add ability to encrypt notes
* Code structure / Technical debt
  * [TODO] Break up main parsing function in star.coffee into separate methods
  * [TODO] Introduce static method (are there static methods in coffeescript?) to ask if a line
    has a star.
  * [TODO] Add some comments
* Tests
  * I'm already getting to the point where it is difficult to retest everything and I only have 250 line CoffeeScript
    file.  We need some spec tests.
  * [TODO] Write unit tests for grammar
* Coding templates / helpful keystrokes
  * [TODO] Allow user to set default ISO-8601 timezone

      * If this works at all anymore, it doesn't work on Mac -- I don't have these menu commands.
    * There is a Download button in onedrive.live.com!!!
      * It does export all of the Onenote files in .one format
      * Unfortunately, I have no idea what .one format is.
  * [TODO] Migration from Evernote
    * [How to export](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-jump-ship-from-evernote-and-take-your-data-with-1782841075)
    * [Export to SimpleNote Utility](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-jump-ship-from-evernote-and-take-your-data-with-1782841075)
      * Simplenote doesn't really import simple text anymore, but this could still be a useful starting point.
